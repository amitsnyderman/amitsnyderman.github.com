Yesterday I got a birthday card from my grandmother. Thanks mom mom. Besides the check that accompanied the card, opening it also greeted me with a cheesy "happy birthday" country tune. Neat.

Even neater that I could now dissect it and identify the parts and how they work.

Specifically how the switch works is rather ingenious: a ribbon of plastic with a hole travels back and forth with the opening and closing of the card. The hole, upon the card opening, exposes two pieces of metal and the card sings. At first I thought the switch was mediated by a flex sensor but I find the simplicity in how this works pretty cool.

The only thing I'm unclear about is how they managed to store the audio clip. There's a black dome-y thing that seems like it could be a little memory chip, or something.
