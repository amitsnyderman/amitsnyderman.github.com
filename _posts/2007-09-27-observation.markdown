During my [M5 bus][route] ride for Red's class I watched about 20 people wail on the rear doors attempting to get off the bus. Here's what the rear door exit looks like:

</div>

The sign on the door reads:

> Air Assist Doors  
> Opens automatically when:  
> 1. Green light is on  
> 2. Yellow tape on door is touched

Except it doesn't. Or not instantly. Either way it's not exactly apparent if pressing hard on the tape has anything to do with the door opening or is just normal behavior for pressing hard on a door. And it seems people expect the door to be available to open the moment the bus stops, despite the sign instructing them to wait for the green light.

A better solution might be a big (think 4" x 8") push button that lights up when the door's ready to open. Then the signal and action are correlated in a single device with a definite on/off indication and a definite pushed/not-pushed state.
