The most salient comment Despina made in class was, "are there connection that exist that we cannot see? Can you expose them?" In looking for a connector, it seemed appropriate to consider the connections that I most value and cherish.

I love making music. With other people in small groups, large groups, alone. Like love or a great conversation, there's no one thing that identifies what makes the moments special beyond the subliminal. The butterflies. It fills you completely. You're in sync. Anticipate the turns. Resonating. Two sine waves weaving out of phase collide with each other resulting in dissonance. At time severe. But when they're in phase their signal is amplified. Resonating. The effect is filling and fulfilling.

"Double Bass" provides an opportunity for two to connect through resonance. It's a washtub bass, or "gutbucket", constructed of a 15 gallon tin wash basin, two mop handles, and a string (in this case made of weed whacker twine). The bass has a rich tone connecting two players (or potentially more) through both sound and the physicality of the vibrations coming through their hands.

Unfortunately the recording sounds like poo. Perhaps someone in class caught video with some decent audio quality.
