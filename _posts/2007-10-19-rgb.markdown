Trying to hit two things at once: this week's lab playing with transistors and my group's midterm task to generate an RGB color from three LEDs. Here's what I've got thus far:

</div>

The code is simple enough:

<code>
<pre>
#define RED_LED 11
#define GREEN_LED 10
#define BLUE_RED 9

struct rgb {
	int red;
	int green;
	int blue;
};

rgb myColor = {125, 125, 125};

void setup() {
	pinMode(RED_LED, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(GREEN_LED, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(BLUE_RED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
	analogWrite(RED_LED, myColor.red * 4);
	analogWrite(GREEN_LED, myColor.green * 4);
	analogWrite(BLUE_RED, myColor.blue * 4);
}
</pre>
</code>

Next step is to get serial input from Processing which is cross-fading RGB values and mirror the output via the Arduino...

Too bad the LEDs I'm testing with all have different brightness ratings; mostly the color made is all B with little G or R, no matter how much wax paper it gets diffused through.
