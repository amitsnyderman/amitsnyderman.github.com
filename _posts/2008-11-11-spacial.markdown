In brainstorming for this week's assignment (which is going mildly well) I keep falling into the thought pattern of spaces that we inhabit while in the midst of another space; nesting dolls of space. Disappearing into a book amidst a busy subway car. Spending over 50% of my day in a flat digital space on a screen in an office. Connecting to that digital space remotely from my home, though where does that space exist if it's digital anyway? This numbing mind-loop is a space I've been stuck in... so along with the rest of the internet, found this image amusing and appropriate.
