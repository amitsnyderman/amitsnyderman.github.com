In class this morning the idea of physically quantifying virtual data -- amongst a bunch of other themes -- came up as a result of seeing the [Wable][wable]. At what scale, order of magnitude or difference in value do we simply stop comprehending? I'm having a hard time swallowing [President Bush's $2.9 trillion 2009 budget proposal][budget] and [Microsoft's $44.6 billion bid for Yahoo][yahoo], let alone how much my recent home buying experience cost in legal fees.

[How Much Does It Buy][howmuch] is a cute way of attempting to illustrate this scale. Of course I can't imagine what a field of 3,064,567,261.97 cows might look like either...
