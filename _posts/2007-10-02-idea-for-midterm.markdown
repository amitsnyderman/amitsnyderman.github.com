There are lots of drones in New York City, myself included.  
Smash the alarm in the morning.  
Take vitamins.  
Match some sort of an outfit.  
Mutter "good morning" to the doorman.  
Ingest hot caffeinated drink of choice.  
Delete spam.

These could all be opportunities to play. Create some sort of excitement or smile to inject some humanity into the routines that we all fall trap to.

Maybe the elevator likes my red shirt.  
Or instructs me to compliment the person beside me wearing the red shirt.  
Or perhaps it just shouts out me.

Maybe the newspaper that's handed to me in the morning flutters and flies away.

Maybe the sidewalk tells me to slow down.  
Or teach me a little bit of history about the buildings.

Maybe a door opens conditionally upon completion of a puzzle.  
Or the revolving door's a giant kaleidoscope.

I always dream of lightly tapping the underside of one's chin or nose when they're enmeshed in their iPod/Blackberry/digital something device. It would be fun to create something that taps me out of those drone-y moments.
