## What do I do to procrastinate?

What don't I do to procrastinate is a better question. Almost anything that's even slightly more enjoyable or readily available than what I should be doing is game. It doesn't matter if the vice is tedious. If anything, the most common feature of these is that superficially there are limits that can be set. And violated to the point of obsession. And distraction.

* Research
* Go out for meals and ice cream
* Agree to running errands
* Obsessively organize. iTunes music library and kitchen cabinets are frequent victims
* Watch one TV show. Which leads to three
* Watch football. All day long
* Crossword puzzles
* Play addictive computer games
* Let research lead me to unrelated reading
* Sleep
* Water the garden
* Draw/doodle
* Read

## What leads me to overcome procrastination?

* **Deadlines:** I hate disappointing myself and others. Not accomplishing something stresses me out more than anything (well, perhaps a close second to inconveniencing/burdening others). So I do it. Perhaps not on the schedule that I had planned on. Definitely with less sleep than is required for me. But it gets done.

* **Peer Inconvenience:** If someone's dependent on me accomplishing the task (often frequent pressure *is* required... and guilt trips. Guilt work well), it grudgingly gets done. And two things generally result of it: 1) I enjoy doing it, and/or 2) I enjoy the byproduct of having done it.

Or sometimes I just don't start. Best not to admit to those.
