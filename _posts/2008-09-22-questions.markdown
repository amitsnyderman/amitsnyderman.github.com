Does the insertion of a module into a space change the overall object? What it means? Should it? Is it transparent? Can a prosthetic be considered a module? Are interchangeable modules functionally similar? Or does a swap lead to a change in the nature of the parent object? Is it just the interface that remains constant? Does a module care about its context?

Think about UNIX pipes. Data is funneled through various modules. Data flows through, modified. Possible shift in modality. Data representation.

Clearly stumped for a focused idea.
