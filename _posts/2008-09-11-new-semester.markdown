Summer's over. Time to pay attention to the blog again and write more thoughtfully than [Twitter might encourage](http://twitter.com/amitsnyderman).

Two classes of interest this semester:

* [The Softness of Things: Technology in Space and Form](http://itp.nyu.edu/softness/2008/softness.html)
* [Election 2008: Social Software and User Generated Media](http://its.nyu.edu/election)
