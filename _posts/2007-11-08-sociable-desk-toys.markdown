People collect lots of desk toys.

What if these toys could play in an online space? As physical avatars? Analog actions transmitted digitally to analog recipients.

I don't know about you but I think receiving an icon of a plush toy or a button-clicked hug in Facebook is rather lame. And one-to-one communications are a start. What about a group hug? Orgy? Bitch-fest?
