If I step over a crack with my left foot, the right one's gotta account for a crack of its own. Ditto with knuckle cracking and most everything having the potential for symmetry. The same compulsion bleeds into my programming where every character and space needs to be accounted for and have purpose.

Luckily there are limits (not sure why or how): I don't keep todo lists, or perfectly arrange things on my desk, or even make sure that my clothes match.

But this breadboard thing, with its perfectly lined up holes, color coded wires pulled tautly between connections... luckily it's fun otherwise we might have an unhealthy obsession on hand.
