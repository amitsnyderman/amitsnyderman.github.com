Elevators are cozy spots where the norm is to step in, press your button, and then silently stare to the front until it's time to step off.

Most elevator experiences in a building are characterized by roughly 4 parameters:

* Number of floors
* Number of elevators
* Speed of elevators
* Frequency of use

Personally I hate the idea of wasting someone else's time, and also when others waste mine. May also extend into the fact that I don't like attention, and that if I'm holding someone up their attention--negative attention--is focused at me. Anyways, it seems that people most often get frustrated in elevators when it's their time that is being inconvenienced/wasted/abused.

So we're going to do one of the following as an experiment:

* Upon entering the elevator, press every single button
* Upon entering the elevator, request that every single button be pressed on your behalf

What scorn ensues?
