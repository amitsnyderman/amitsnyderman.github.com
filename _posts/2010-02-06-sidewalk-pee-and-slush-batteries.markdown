For our first assignment in _Design Frontiers in Biology and Materiality_ we were asked to recreate a science fair project from our childhood. Besides a project on dams back in 3rd grade, my most memorable science experiments came from my undergraduate neuroscience labs. Probably the coolest was when we embedded electrodes into a cockroach leg to read nerve impulses generated from tickling its hairs, but given the overhead in hardware isn't a feasible option for recreating in class.

So instead I'm going to revisit playing with [lemon batteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_battery), something I had a [go round with a few semesters ago](http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/as860/iameat/2008/12/slush.html).

Making lemon batteries is fun. It makes you wonder what other solution and materials might serve as an electricity source? As a result of two events over the last week —- the adoption of my new puppy Teddy and a snowfall —- I've spent a considerable amount of time outside and have noticed an abundance of two solutions that I have a hunch might substitute for lemon juice: *pee* and *salty snow melt*.

Using copper scrubbers and aluminum foil as electrodes, I recorded the voltage generated from a single circuit of each of these solutions:

<table>
<thead>
	<tr>
	<th>Solution</th>
	<th>Voltage</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
	<td>Lemon Juice</td>
	<td>.604 V</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Pee</td>
	<td>.468 V</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Calcium Chloride + Water</td>
	<td>.770 V</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I'm intrigued by the fact that pee works; further tests could check the effects of temperature, concentration, and volume on voltage as well as using different metals as electrodes. In researching lemon battery variations I came across a few configurations that work effectively for a decent amount of time (a few hours) using very little liquid in combination with [joule thiefs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_thief).

If enough energy can be converted, a few pee-activated/powered applications that come to mind are:

* a security camera to capture those who do not curb their pets
* embedded sidewalk/curb/building lighting
* self-powered auto-flush toilets
* eco-friendly camping batteries
