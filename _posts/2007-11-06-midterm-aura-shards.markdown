For our physical computing midterm, we created a light and sound fixture/environment that reads the collective affect of a community and injects a new environment intended to align the community's chakras. The overall pipeline looks something like this:

## Affect Data Source

Rather than attempt to capture and evaluate an aura image (if such a thing is even possible or exists), we defined aura in terms of language and text. Communities converse online. A lot. Using ITP as our sample community, syndicated blog feeds, a number of student mailing lists, and the ITP wiki served as data sources collected over intervals of time.

Download the Python code for the text extraction:

* [source.py][]
* [fetch.py][]

The following data files are expected to be in the `./etc` directory: `feeds.txt` and `lists.txt`.
