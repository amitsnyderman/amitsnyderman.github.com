Just picked up my Polar CHR-39025379 board (thanks [Anh][anh]) sans data sheet. Luckily Dan O. had a copy on the ["Computers for the Rest of You" class page][rest] (hidden in a directory listing) that I'm leaving here for future reference as a PDF: [Polar CHR-39025379 Data Sheet][datasheet]

It's a little larger than I had hoped for but should serve well as a quick way to get up and prototyping.
