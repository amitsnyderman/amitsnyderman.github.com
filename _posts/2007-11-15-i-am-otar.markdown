**[Teratoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma)** *tĕr'ə-tō'mə*

> The tissues of a teratoma, although normal in themselves, may be quite different from surrounding tissues, and may be highly inappropriate, even grotesque (hence the monstrous): teratomas have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and very rarely more complex organs such as eyeball, torso, and hand.
