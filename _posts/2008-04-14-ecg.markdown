So after many hours of researching, it seems that there are three predominant methods for reading a person's pulse:

1. **LED/Photocell Finger Method:** Found in local drugstores and basic hospital heart monitoring, essentially you shine a light through your finger and catch it on the other side, where fluctuations in the amount of light shone correlate with pulsing blood levels. *Cheap and a relatively easy circuit to build*.

2. **Electrode Method:** Used in [ECG/EKG][ECG] applications, uses electrodes attached to the body to measure the electrical activity of the beating heart. [DIY circuits][OpenEEG] all come with the caveat of potential shock and death. *Cheap but more complicated, potentially harmful, circuits*.

3. **Buy Method:** Use an off-the-shelf [heart rate monitor][monitor] such as those sold by Polar, which come in a [chest band][polarT31] (~$40) and [wireless receiver][polarWRL] ($14.95). The also sell an [OEM board][polarOEM]. *Expensive but easy and reliable*.
