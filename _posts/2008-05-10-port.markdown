For the [bio-feedback plugin notification framework](http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/as860/iameat/2008/05/prosthesis.html), the system ended up being programmed in Python, resulting in some useful tools for working with serial data and XBee radios.

Why Python? No particular reason, though its use evolved because of 1) Python's awesome [`cmd` module](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-cmd.html), and 2) an existing and convenient [serial library](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/).

These tools resulted in the creation of an [XBee shell application](http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/as860/iameat/2008/04/serial.html) and a port of [Rob Faludi's XBee Processing library](http://www.faludi.com/code/xbee-api-library-for-processing/) to Python.

These tools are available as a [Google code project](http://code.google.com/p/python-xbee). Please help make them better.
